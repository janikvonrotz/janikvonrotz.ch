Hi, my name is Janik von Rotz. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer / IT Consultant from Switzerland.

This is my blog where I share my personal and professional experiences. It is mostly about IT-related stuff. I always and still admire the Open Source Software (OSS) community, where everybody shares their insight and solution for the benefit of the whole. This blog is a contribution to this community.

Here are a few things about me:

* I did some [traveling](https://gist.github.com/janikvonrotz/37dc61480790b07ab91d88d624caef2b) in the past. Not so much anymore as flying has a huge impact on the environment.
* There is not enough time to [read books](/tags/book).
* As with books I'm not taking enough [photos](/categories/photography/).

I describe my personality in 3 words:

* Curious
* Dedicated
* Open-Minded

At work I value:

* Collaboration and autonomy
* Openess and honesty
* Leaness and speed

Let me know if you:

* Come to Switzerland
* Are working on a cool project and need help
* Want to discuss anything related to my work

I believe in:

* [User Data Manifesto](https://userdatamanifesto.org/)
* [GNU Manifest](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html)
* [Open Source Software](https://opensourcesoftware.ch)

Currently I am working on:

* Learning Kubernetes
* Build a SaaS-Plattform for my company [Mint System GmbH](https://www.mint-system.ch/) 
* Support Open Source Software
