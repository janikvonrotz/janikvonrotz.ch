*Yes, that's me.*

Janik von Rotz from Switzerland. Did an apprenticeship as IT system engineer back in 2012. Then worked for a public transport company for two years as computer scientist. And now studying for my bachelor of science in business and information technology. While working on different IT projects I taught myself a lot about web development. Started with simple web design with Typo3 and jQuery, then learned some PHP working with Laravel and now since a few months learning JavaScript, Meteor and React. Another language to mention here is also Java, in the first year of my study I've built a huge knowledge base starting from basic OOP to 3-tier software architecture with Java. Always interested in new technologies and excited about whats coming next.
