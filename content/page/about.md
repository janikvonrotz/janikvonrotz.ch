Hi, my name is Janik von Rotz. Iâ€™m a system engineer and software developer from Switzerland and have got a BSc in Business and Information Technology.

This is my blog where I share experiences of my personal and professional life. I firmly believe that sharing insightful stories and ideas without aiming for profit or reputation leads to a collaborative and progressive social community.

I like to ...

* [travel the world](https://gist.github.com/janikvonrotz/37dc61480790b07ab91d88d624caef2b)
* [read books](https://gist.github.com/janikvonrotz/48bfb518239970395b12285b3c23fbfd)
* [take photos](/categories/photography/)

and try whenver to ...

* keep my identity small
* make strong social bonds
* aim for actions and results

let me know if ...

* you come to Switzerland
* you are working on a cool project
* you want to discuss anything related to my work
