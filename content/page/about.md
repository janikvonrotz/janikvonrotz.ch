Hi, my name is Janik Vonrotz. Iâ€™m a Software Engineer / IT Consultant from Switzerland.

This is my blog where I share my personal and professional experiences. It is mostly about IT-related stuff. I always and still admire the Open Source Software (OSS) community, where everybody shares their insight and solution for the benefit of the whole. This blog is a contribution to this community.

Here are a few things about me:

* I did some [traveling](https://gist.github.com/janikvonrotz/37dc61480790b07ab91d88d624caef2b) in the past. Not so much anymore as flying has a huge impact on the environment.
* There is not enough time to [read books](https://gist.github.com/janikvonrotz/48bfb518239970395b12285b3c23fbfd).
* Like with books I'm not taking enough [photos](/categories/photography/).

I describe my personality in 3 words:

* Curious
* Dedicated
* Open-Minded

At work I value:

* Collaboration and autonomy
* Openess and honesty
* Leaness and speed

Let me know if you:

* Come to Switzerland
* Are working on a cool project and need help
* Want to discuss anything related to my work

Currently I am working on various opportunities and projects:

* Get the latest startup [Mint System GmbH](https://www.mint-system.ch/) up and running.
* Developing web applications as [Apland GmbH](https://apland.ch).
* Helping companies to improve their business with software.
* Searching for challenges to improve my soft and tech skills.
