# Introduction

The complex problems of identity and access management (IAM) have challenged big companies and in result we got powerful protocols, technologies and concepts such as SAML, oAuth, Keycloack, tokens and much more.

The goal of IAM is simple. Centralize all identities, policies and get rid of application identity stores. Not only is more secure to manage logins in one place, but you can also offer a better user experience. As the title says we want to connect our centralized identity management software Keycloack with our application Nextcloud.

Nextcloud supports multiple modules and protocols for authentication. The one that is around for quite some time is SAML. It is complicated to configure, but enojoys a broad support.

The SAML authentication process step by step:

![SAML Authentication](/images/SAML%20Authentication.png)

The service provider is Nextcloud and the identity provider is Keycloack.

In this guide the keycloack service is running as `login.example.com` and nextcloud as `cloud.example.com`.

## Prepare Keycloack realm and key material

Navigate to the Keycloack console [https://login.example.com/auth/admin/console](https://login.example.com/auth/admin/console)

Create a new realm *example.com*.

Navigate to the *keys* tab and copy the *Certificate* content of the RSA entry to an empty texteditor. We require this certificate later on.

Open a shell and run the following command to generate a certificate.

```bash
openssl req  -nodes -new -x509  -keyout private.key -out public.cert
```

This certificate will be used to identify the Nextcloud SP.

## Setup Nextcloud

Open the Nextcloud app page [https://cloud.example.com/index.php/settings/apps](https://cloud.example.com/index.php/settings/apps).

Install the *SSO & SAML authentication* app.

Navigate to *Settings > Administration > SSO & SAML authentication* and select *Use built-in SAML authentication*.

Then walk through the configuration sections below.

**Global Settings**

Select these options:

- [ - ] Only allow authentication if an account exists on some other backend. (e.g. LDAP)

- [ - ] Use SAML auth for the Nextcloud desktop clients (requires user re-authentication)

- [ x ] Allow the use of multiple user back-ends (e.g. LDAP)

Allow use of multible user back-ends will allow to select the login method. You can disable this setting once Keycloak is connected successfuly. 

For the IDP *Provider 1* set these configurations:

**General**

Attribute to map the UID to: `username`  
Optional display name: `Login Example`

The user id will be mapped from the `username` attribute in the SAML assertion.

**Service Provider Data**

x.509 certificate of the Service Provider: Copy the content of the `public.cert` file.  
Private key of the Service Provider: Copy the content of the `private.key` file.

This certificate is used to sign the SAML request.

**Identity Proivder Data**

Identifier of the IdP: [https://login.example.com/auth/realms/example.com](https://login.example.com/auth/realms/example.com)  
URL Target of the IdP where the SP will send the Authentication Request Message: [https://login.example.com/auth/realms/example.com/protocol/saml](https://login.example.com/auth/realms/example.com/protocol/saml)  
URL Location of IdP where the SP will send the SLO Request: [https://login.example.com/auth/realms/example.com/protocol/saml](https://login.example.com/auth/realms/example.com/protocol/saml)  
Public X.509 certificate of the IdP: Copy the certificate from the texteditor. You will need to add `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` in front of the key and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` to the end of it.

This certificate is used to sign the SAML assertion.

**Attribute mapping**

Attribute to map the email address to.: `email`  
Attribute to map the user groups to.: `Role`

The email address and role assignment are managed in Keycloack, therefor we need to map this attributes from the SAML assertion.

**Security Settings**

Check the following options:

![Nextcloud SAML security settings](/images/Nextcloud%20SAML%20security%20settings.png)

Validate the metadata and download the `metadata.xml` file.

We are ready to register the SP in Keycloack.

# Register service provider

Open the Keycloack console again and select your realm. Navigate to *Clients* and click on the *Create* button.

Use the import function to upload the `metadata.xml` file.

Update the *Client SAML Endpoint* field with: [https://login.example.com/auth/realms/example.com](https://login.example.com/auth/realms/example.com).

Then open the *mappers* tab.

**Mappers**

Create these mappers:

Name: `username`  
Mapper Type: *User Property*  
Property: `username`  
Friendly Name: `username`  
SAML Attribute Name: `username`  
SAML Attribute NameFormat: *Basic*

Name: `email`  
Mapper Type: *User Property*  
Property: `email`  
Friendly Name: `email`  
SAML Attribute Name: `email`  
SAML Attribute NameFormat: *Basic*

Name: `roles`  
Mapper Type: *Role List*  
Role attribute name: `Roles`  
Friendly Name: `Roles`  
SAML Attribute NameFormat: *Basic*  
Single Role Attribute: *On*

In addition the *Single Role Attribute* option needs to be enabled in a different section. Navigate to *Configure > Client scopes > role_list > Mappers > role_list* and toggle the *Single Role Attribute* to *On*.

If these mappers have been created, we are ready to log in.

# Test the login

First ensure that there is a Keycloack user in the realm to login with. Navigate to *Manage > Users* and create a user if needed. The following attributes must be set:

* Username
* Email
* Credentials
* Role Mappings

The role can be managed under *Configure > Roles* and then set in the user view under the *Role Mappings* tab. Or you can set a role per client under *Configure > Clients > *select client* > Tab Roles*.

In your browser open [https://cloud.example.com](https://cloud.example.com) and choose *login.example.com*. You will now be redirected to the Keycloack login page. Enter your credentials and on a successfull login you should see the Nextcloud home page.

Nextcloud will create the user if it is not available.

If you see the Nextcloud welcome page everything worked!

# Troubleshooting

**Debugging**

Error logging is very restict in the auth process. Set `'debug' => true,` in the Nextcloud `config.php` to get more details.
