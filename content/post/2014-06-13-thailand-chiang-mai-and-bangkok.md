Almost 2 weeks passed since I've left home to go to Thailand. It's unbelievable what happened in this short amount of time, here are my best memories so far.
<!--more-->

* Living in the village of northern hill tribes
* Met funny, amazing and interesting people from all over world
* Riding an elephant (whose not prisoned like the most you'll see there)
* Shared stories and learned a lot about thai people
* Shooting with a 0.45 pistol and M16 rifle
* Rent a scooter in Chiang Mai and fought with the busy traffic (almost crashed one time)
* Cuddling with tigers (they were drugged and prisoned, but this is still better than selling them to china via the black market)
* Eaten the best meals so far
* And much more ;)
