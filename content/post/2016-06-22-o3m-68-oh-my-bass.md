Hey there. This time I got some bass blasting flipping vocal tracks for you. Overwerks latest tracks made the finisher and made it a great list. Nice to hear that he's still on track and still produces amazing stuff. However a featuring with Sia seems like the music industries commercialisation finally got him hooked up.
