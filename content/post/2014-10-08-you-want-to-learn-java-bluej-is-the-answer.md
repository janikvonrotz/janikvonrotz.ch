So you decided to learn some Java programming, but you don't know where to start?

Let me help you. The first thing you should do is to visit the website: [http://www.bluej.org/](http://www.bluej.org/)

BlueJ is a free Java development environment especially designed for beginners.

Install this neat piece of software and in addition download some code to experiment form the BlueJ homepage [http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/resources/projects.zip](http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/resources/projects.zip).

Now you'll need something to read. An official book is available on the BlueJ homepage: [http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/](http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/)

If you're too lazy to pay for the book, you still can torrent it [https://kickass.to/objects-first-with-java-5e-pdf-t7455286.html](https://kickass.to/objects-first-with-java-5e-pdf-t7455286.html).
**Disclaimer!**: This is not my torrent, I don't take any responsibility for this link. I recommend to buy the book.

Don't forget to buy the book if you like it and have fun!
