I feel very uncertain about the near future. Climate change, migration, pandemics, rise of populism, oligopolistic capitalism i, post-fact, artificial intelligence, the list goes on.  It is a lot to think about and to make sense of. However, I try to embrace what comes and avoid doom and gloom. Making up new words is one way into the future.
