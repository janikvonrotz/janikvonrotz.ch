For those who don't know him, Michio Kaku is great speaker and scientist. Via [http://bigthink.com/](http://bigthink.com/) he shares his big ideas about how things works and how the future looks like. Recently I really enjoyed his thoughts about the solar power revolution and it's cause. You should definitely check it out!
