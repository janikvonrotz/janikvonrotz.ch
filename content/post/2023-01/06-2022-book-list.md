In 2022 I read 18 books. Some of them were good and some bad. Out of these books only two stuck with me: **There Is No Antimemetics Division** by qntm and **Undinge** by Byung-Chul Han.

**There Is No Antimemetics Division** deals with the idea of antimemes, which is the opposite of a meme or to put it plainly is non-information. [qntm](https://qntm.org/)  is a prolific writer for the [scp wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/). Scp is a database of fictional anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena. The idea of antimemes is very strange and difficult to grasp, however, qntm built a very engaing story with this subject.

**Undinge** is an exploration of paradigm shifts of things becoming "smart" things. Han is a contemporary philosopher and in this book he skilfully describes the problem of objects that suddenly produce data and dictate to us as humans.

And here is the full 2022 book list:
