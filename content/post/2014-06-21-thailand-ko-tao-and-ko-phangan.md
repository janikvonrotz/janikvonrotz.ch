Back in Bangkok I had to say goodbye to my travel friends from Chiang Mai, first I was a bit anxious about me not being able to meet new people. However I didn't expect that's actually so easy, there are so many travellers down south with almost the same plan as me. And when you're travelling alone it's even more easy to meet new people as you don't stay in a isolated group.

From the north of Thailand I moved down south and took a ferry to the small island Ko Tao. Ko Tao is a small and picturesque place. I met many people who had planned to stay there for just a couple days, but ended up living there for the last six month. It seems to be one of those island you unlikely want to leave when you're travelling without a plan :D

Apart from the moon parties (every six days for every phase of the moon) Ko Phangan is a quite relaxing island. Great to explore with a scooter or just to hang out at the beach.

To round up this story some more pictures:
