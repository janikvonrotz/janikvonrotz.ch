SSL certificates aren't cheap. You can create them on your own for private use. 
However for internet use you have to get a verified certificate.

Luckily there's [https://www.startssl.com/](https://www.startssl.com/)

They offer you a class 1 SSL certificate for free. Their site might not look trustworthy, but I'm quite shure they do a great job.
