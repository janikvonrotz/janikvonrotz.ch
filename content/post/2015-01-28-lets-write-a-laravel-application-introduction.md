I'm going to develop a [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) application with my friends. The application is called RowBook. It will be a simple tool to log all the trips of the [row club Lucerne](http://www.seeclub-luzern.ch/).

As I've never used Laravel or another php framework before, I will share my first time experience here on my blog.
Whenever I have to learn about a new technology I'm looking for some basic books and videos. For Laravel I've found the perfect beginners eBook, where you'll learn the most fundamental basics.

**<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Getting-Started-with-Laravel-4.pdf">Download - Getting Started with Laravel 4</a>**

And I also recommend to watch the YouTube videos from phpacademy. They'll tell you how you can build a simple blog engine from scratch.

**[Watch - Simple Laravel Blog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CaoPX7J-o4&list=FLyivmCJn96QC1rqthNlmMyA&index=2)**

In the next post I'll show you how I've setup my first Laravel project. Despite it's the first time I'm using Laravel you can expect a pretty good project template ;)
