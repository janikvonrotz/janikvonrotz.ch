# Unpredictability as the driver

Improving system resilience

# Definition Chaos Engineering

> Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a distributed system
in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability
to withstand turbulent conditions in production.
> -- [principles of chaos engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/)

# Monitoring vs. Observability

> TL:DR; Monitoring tells you whether a system is working, observability lets you ask why it isn't working.

# Definition Observability

> In control theory, observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.
