I backpacked the north of India for three weeks. These are the impressions and memories I got from this amazing trip.

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/01_Garbage everywhere.jpg" title="Garbage everywhere" caption="This was the most shocking part when I arrived in India. There is trash everywhere and obviously no system nor institution that cares about collecting and recycling trash." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/02_Lost in Old Delhi.jpg" title="Lost in Old Delhi" caption="Old Delhi is the most busiest place on earth for sure. It was exhausting but also pleasureable experience to dive into the twisty alleys and let your perception be overwhelmed by all the unnumerable impressions." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/03_Spice market.jpg" title="Spice market" caption="This picture depicts the everyday life and business that takes place at the spice market in Old Dehli." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/05_Hiking in McLeodGanj.jpg" title="Hiking in McLeodGanj" caption="While on a hike I was suprised by rain and thick fog. Exploring the calm peaks close to McLeodGanj is something I would recommend everybody when visiting India." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/06_Lower Himalayan mountains.jpg" title="Lower Himalayan mountains" caption="Even though these mountains are part of the lower Himalayans they already rise up to over 5000m in elevation." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/07_Bus ride.jpg" title="Bus ride" caption="Busses connect almost every part of India. It is the most frequented way of transport. However, due to worn out and bumpy roads a ride takes a lot of time." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/08_Marks of colonialism.jpg" title="Marks of colonialism" caption="The scars of the British colonialism have not yet healed. This picture shows the marks of a massacre which took place in Amritsar in 1919. 379 people were killed as they defied the ban of public meetings." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/09_Sleeping on the train.jpg" title="Sleeping on the train" caption="Taking a 24 hours ride with a sleeping train is must do when visiting India. Sharing a wagon compartment with 7 other people is memorable experience. The locals are curious and always glad if they can share a meal with you." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/10_Blue train.jpg" title="Blue train" caption="The train network connects the bigger cities of India. Vast landscapes and tiny villages waiting along the rails, makes one feel lost and long for exploration." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/11_Rooftops of Varanasi.jpg" title="Rooftops of Varanasi" caption="The wild and uncontrolled growth of buildings turn into picturesque and colorful paintings when watched from above." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/12_Boats of Varanasi.jpg" title="Boats of Varanasi" caption="If it floats it counts as a boat. The piers of Varanasi are overcrowded with boats. Taking a ride lets one the watch the happenings of Varanasi from a distance." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/13_Never asleep.jpg" title="Never asleep" caption="Indian people travel from all over to take a bath in the Ganges river, wash away their sins and bury their dead family members." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/14_Sunset.jpg" title="Sunset" caption="During the day India is unbearable hot. During sunset India becomes unbearable beautiful." >}}

{{< figure src="/images/Magnificient India/15_Hidden village in Rishikesh.jpg" title="Hidden village in Rishikesh" caption="If you seek calmness and a spirituel experience go to Rishikesh. Go for a hike and explore the mountains and jungles. I started walking up a little peak and ended up in this village. Received some food for no money and spent some time gazing at the clouds. When I remind myself of that place I become relaxed and calm." >}}
