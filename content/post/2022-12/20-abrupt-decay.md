I am an (addicted) [Magic: The Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) player. I love the game, its complexity, the story and of course its art. The card in the header image is [Abrupt Decay](https://scryfall.com/card/mm3/146/abrupt-decay). Inspired by its caption and artwork I wrote a short poem about decay and regress:

<!--more-->

> Dreaming a life beyond others\
> Nothing to fear nothing to bother
> 
> Still human still craving\
> Always healing and raving
> 
> An invincible structure\
> Yet built to puncture
> 
> Once robust and strong\
> Now crumbling for long
> 
> A fleeting grasp for more\
> Silently pulled from the shore
> 
> Contained by ignorance\
> Attend the last dance
> 
> A thought to deny\
> to believe in a lie 
> 
> A ferocious rile\
> with a desperate smile
> 
> Here for the eve\
> Nothing to leave
> 
> Waiting for others\
> Calling for mother
> 
> There is no restart\
> when falling apart
