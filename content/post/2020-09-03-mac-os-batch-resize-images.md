You can easily batch resize groups of images within Mac OS by using the included Preview app, that is, taking a group of pictures set at one or various resolutions, and collectively resize them all together in a group to a new resolution.
<!--more-->

* Select all the images you want resized in the Finder, and then open them within the Preview app
* From Preview, select all of the images that you want to batch resize from the left-side thumbnail drawer (`command + a` will select them all)
* Now, go to the menu labeled "Tools", and then choose "Adjust Size"
* Enter a value for what you want the new width and height to be
* Next, navigate to the "File" menu and click "Save All" or, to save a new version that is resized, choose "Export Selected Images..." or "Save As"
