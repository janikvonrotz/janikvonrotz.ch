You might already knew it, the link **http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ULSViewer** for the most popular ULS viewer doesn't work anymore.

Luckily I've found a copy on my SharePoint server, you can get it below.

![Microsoft-ULS-Log-Viewer](https://janikvonrotz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Microsoft-ULS-Log-Viewer.png)

[**Download UlsViewer 2.0.3530.27850**](https://janikvonrotz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/UlsViewer-2.0.3530.27850.zip)

If you have a newer copy of the file it would be nice if you share it with me.
