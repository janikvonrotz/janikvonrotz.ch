Hi visiter,

As you might have already seen, this websites is now  accessible over https.

I've moved this website to a new custom webserver run by [Amazon AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/de/ec2/).

I'm still trying to fix some minor errors, so don't be confused if the website is not reachable for a certain time.
