Being employed to think and to care can become a quite burden over time. I thought about "stress" a lot and would like to share my learnings:

*Edit 2024-04-11: I updated the title and image, it felt too negative.*

**Experience**

Hit the wall as early as possible.

The time to recover is more or less the same time that you got you there.

A mental "rubber wall" prevents exhaustive thoughts.

Make sure to know what gives you energy and what drains it. A net positive is a must.

**Biology**

As a species, we share the human psyche like our skeleton. The mental processes are mostly the same.

When working physically you become tired. When working mentally you don't. Having idle times is important

Biologically we fail to handle constant stress. We adapt continuously until the body revolts. Very much like the [boiling frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog)

**Stress**

Having a tense time is different from having a stressful time.

Stress must be differentiated. There is [distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(medicine)) and [eustress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustress).

Eustress is a positive cognitive response to stress. For  example, it gets out of the bed in the morning.

Distress ist the opposite of eustress and is more researched. People under constant distress become sick, mentally or physically.
