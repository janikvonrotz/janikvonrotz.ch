I love podcast and now spend more time than ever listening. It is a growing business and therefore there are tons of good and bad podcasts. Let's talk about the good ones. Here are my favourites:

# Philosophize This!

No clue about philosophy, but looking for a beginner friendly educational podcast? Steven West explains everything you need to know in a genuine and comprehensible manner.

# Freakonomics

A book, a blog and a podcast. Based on the most readable economics blog and [bestseller books](http://freakonomics.com/books/) Steve Dubner and Steven Lewitt are running a radio show and talking about the hidden side of everything.

# Stuff You Should Know

This is another popular podcast where mostly science related and interesting stuff is discussed.

# Caliphate

A very tense audio series following Rukmini Callimachi as she reports on the Islamic State and the fall of Mosul.

# Verbrechen

If you are German speaking and love crimes and thrillers you will love this podcast.

# Servus. Grüezi. Hallo.

Again a gem for the German speakers. A Swiss, Austrian and German journalist from Zeit discussing issues and topics which they share.

# Eine Stunde History

Short and understandable history lessons in German. They discuss historic events in a non-chronological order with various experts.
