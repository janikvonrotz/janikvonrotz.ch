<h1>About</h1>

Based on new business requirements our intranet SharePoint needs an update from version 2010 to 2013.
The new installation will be part in our existing Office 365 hybrid environment.
As I've completed the Core Solutions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 course I going to perform this project on my own.
In this series of posts I would like to share my knowledge and experience in building this new intranet based on SharePoint 2013.
