Yesterday Prof. Dr. Diego Kuonen paid a visit at my company and held a lecture about data science and analytics. I enjoyed his presentation very much.

He spent much time on demystifying well known hype words, such as:

* Big Data
* IoT
* Machine Learning
* AI

He provided definitions for these overloaded terms and gave insight on what statistical methods are applied to these use cases.

In the end it was all far less "magic" than expected. Companies such as IBM bloat these terms as part of their marketing campaigns in order to find companies to join the hypetrain and fund their research projects.
