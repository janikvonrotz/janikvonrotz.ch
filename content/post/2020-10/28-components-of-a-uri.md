The terms URL, URI and URN can be confusing. I wanna make sense for once and for all.
<!--more-->

* URL is a Uniform Resource Locator that tells you the how and where of something.
* URN is a Uniform Resource Name and is simply a unique name.
* URI is a Uniform Resource Identifier and is URL or URN
