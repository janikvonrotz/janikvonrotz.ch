I visited a good friend in Nothern Germany. As he lives off the grid I took the chance to make a short cycle trip and explore the northern Frisian land.

Starting from Hamburg I cycled along the Elbe towards the sea. The cycle roads in this part of Germany are quite bumpy. I rather would have cycled on the street, but car drivers get quite upset when doing so. After 120km I reached the area where the mud flats begin. The mud flats are coastal wetland that is shaped by and exposed to the tidal forces.

The next 120km I have spent cycling along the levees. As you move upwards you will pass the Halligen islands. As a Swiss this was peculiar sight. Little train rails moved directly into the sea without an end in sight. Instead of the Swiss alps connected with cable cars the Halligen houses are connected with tiny trains.

My destination was the island Amrum. From Dageb√ºll I took a ferry to the island. I spent a few days there exploring the dunes and enjoying the village festivities.

After my stay in Amrum I decided to not take the same way back to Hamburg, but instead going to Flensburg via Denmark. The landscape in Denmark was more or less the same, so the trip was not very exciting. Nonetheless I enjoyed the old town of Ribe and spending time at the [Shelter](http://shelterapp.dk/) campsides.

I finished off my trip in Hamburg having a nice coffee at the [Elbgold shop](https://www.elbgoldshop.com/) and enjoying the view on the Aussenlaster lake.
