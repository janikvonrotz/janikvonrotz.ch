This video is a beautiful example of how internet access in remote areas improves the standards of health, education and prosperity. With the help from people all over the world Mahabir Pun has connected over 60.000 people to the world wide web.

This video is also a good example of how to bring the internet to the developing world. Google and Facebook have launched campaigns and programs to achieve such goal, however, the only allow certain access to websites for free. Which means, they are able to control the internet traffic and makes them a threat to the net neutrality. Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally.

There are a lot of important discussions and decision-making going on right now. As always I personally hope that the right and bright people in this process will be able to make the right choices.
