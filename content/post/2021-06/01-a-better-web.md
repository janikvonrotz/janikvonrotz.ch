Use alternative services to make the web more healthy and to stay independent. This guide is separated into a [Consumer](#consumer) and a [Producer](#producer) section.
<!--more-->

## Consumer

Tools and services for consumers.

**Music Streaming**

Buy the music of your favorite artist on <https://bandcamp.com> and use <https://soundcloud.com> to stream.  Quit Spotify, Apple Music or any other Streaming services. Streaming services saved the music industry, but not the artists, only the linked providers ensure a healthy music industry.

**Mail**

Use secure independent mail providers such as <https://protonmail.com/>. Avoid Gmail, Outlook or any other tightly integrated mail service.

**Chat**

Use <https://element.io/> or <https://signal.org/> to chat with friends and family. Do not use Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger or Telegram. They do not protect your privacy.

**Search**

Search the web with <https://duckduckgo.com/>. Try to avoid Google and make DuckDuckGo your default search engine.

**Browsing**

Use <https://www.mozilla.org> to browse the web. It is the only independent browser that actually protects you.

**Storage**

Use alternative storage providers such as <https://www.infomaniak.com/en/kdrive>. Do not save your data on GDrive, OneDrive or iCloud.

**Photo Library**

Try to ignore the Adobe and its Creative Cloud, use <https://www.darktable.org/> to manage your photo library. Ensure you have always access to the photo metadata.

**Office**

Create documents and spreadsheets with <https://www.libreoffice.org/> or <https://www.onlyoffice.com/>.

**Movie Streaming**

Buy movies on <https://vimeo.com/> and try to avoid Netflix, HBO, Disney+ and any other streaming service. Use a TV box from a local internet service provider.

**Note Taking**

Never ever take notes with OneNote, Google Keep or Evernote. Their note taking format is proprietary and you will never ever get your raw data back. Use <https://obsidian.md/>, <https://joplinapp.org/> or any other plain-text note taking tool.

**Operating System**

Install a Linux-based operating system on your computer. Use user friendly distribution such as <https://pop.system76.com/> or <https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop>.

**News**

Do not consume news from click-driven platforms. Use platforms that aim to restore journalism and believe that quality is greater than quantity. In Switzerland we have <https://www.republik.ch/>.

**Maps**

Use a map app such as <https://transportr.app/> that is based on <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>.

## Producer

Tools and services for businesses and creators.

**Groupware**

Office365 or GSuite make your more efficient, but also very dependent. Find a hosting partner and use <https://nextcloud.com/>. 

**Conference**

Setup <https://bigbluebutton.org/> on a server to host meetings and conference talks. Stay away from Zoom or Google Meetings.

**Project Management**

Ditch Microsoft Planner, monday.com, Basecamp, Trello or Asana and use <https://www.openproject.org/>.

**Business Chat**

Setup <https://mattermost.org/> instead of Slack or Teams.

**Business Management Software**

Oracle ERP, Microsoft Dynamics or SAP ERP are big names, but they are not as big as you might think. Use <https://www.odoo.com>, <https://erpnext.com/> or <https://www.tryton.org/> to manage your business.

**Identity Provider**

Do not use Google Login, Azure Login or any third party login provider. Setup <https://www.keycloak.org/> to manage identities and granting access.

**Analytic**

Use <https://plausible.io/> to track visitors on your website.

**Code Editor**

Code with <https://vscodium.com>. It is the same as VSCode, but the licensing is different.

**Hosting**

Find a hosting partner that is not only fluent in Microsoft. The world runs on Linux and Java.
