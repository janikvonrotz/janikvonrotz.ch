In 2023 I read 17 books. Most of them were great, it was difficult to choose my favorites. As most of them were science fiction books, I chose a non-fiction and a fiction book. My favorite fiction book was **The Futurological Congress** by Stanislaw Lem and the non-fiction book is **Corruptible** by Brian Klaas.

And here is the full 2022 book list:
