Domain-ip mapping is essential in developing new websites as you have to test URLs without changing DNS entries.

Yet I've always update the local host file which requires in most cases a restart of the browser. This is a busy an troublesome issue.

Luckily there's for everything a plugin, tool or script, this also goes for host file updates via Chrome/Firefox plugin.

The <a href="https://github.com/tg123/chrome-hostadmin">HostAdmin</a> plugin enables you to update the local host file in you browser in real time without the need to restart the browser.
This plugins saves a lot of time when switching domain-ip mappings for different environments.

Here's a screenshot of the Chrome extension which shows how easy it is to switch on/off an domain-ip mapping.
