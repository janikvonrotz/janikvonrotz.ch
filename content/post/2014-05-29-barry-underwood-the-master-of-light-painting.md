In my last tumblr session I came along a post about Barry Underwood's pictures. He's a photographer with a talent for amazing light painted photos. 

The pictures you're seeing haven't been edited in Photoshop or any other software. Barry Underwood took this photographs with a long exposure camera installation and a bunch of lights.
