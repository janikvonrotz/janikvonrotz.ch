As mentioned to my friends many times I'm a huge fan of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and read it every day (make sure to not get fooled by the misleading name, it has nothing to do with hacking at all). It's about IT news from various domains and sometimes from other domains of science. Today I stumbled upon an article about SOA and microservice while browsing HN. I personally struggled understanding the concept of microservices and its relations to SOA. On one side you'll find very abstract definitions and on the other side there a very specific technical appliances. Anyway, the article blow condensed the whole topic quite nice.
