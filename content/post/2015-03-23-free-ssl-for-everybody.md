[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is the latest initiative by the [Internet Security Research Group (ISRG)](https://letsencrypt.org/about/). 
Their goal is simple, every site on the internet has to be SSL secured.

They want to achieve that by serving an open certificate authority (CA) and also provide a tool to set up a secured site the easiest way possible.

And now the big deal about this, their service is free of charge!

If this is really a thing, it will be a disaster for the SSL economy. As you might know SSL certificates are everything else than cheap. So good luck to every company that relays on selling SSL certificates as their core competence.
