This evening I came along a short documentary that really touched me.

The following video reveals the real cost of our electronic products.

There are people that work themselves to death just to produce our latest favourite smartphone.

I asked my self:

* Is there a real need to obtain always the latest gadet?
* Is it OK that most consumer computer hardware falls apart after one year due to planned obsolescence?
* What can I do to have a positive impact in this issue?

It's very difficult to understand the whole issue as it's almost impossible to guess the origin and real costs of electronic products when we buy them in the next store.
However this is not excuse the ignore this obvious existing problem.

I think it's time have more transparency in the manufacture chain of electronic hardware.
Our food is labeled with ingredients, why shouldn't we do the same for electronic products? 
It's time to show the people what they're really buying.
As a good example of how to accomplish this check out the [Fairphone](http://www.fairphone.com/).
