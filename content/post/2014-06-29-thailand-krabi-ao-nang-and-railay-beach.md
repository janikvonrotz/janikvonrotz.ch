Yesterday I left Thailand and went to Penang in Malaysia. I wished I had more time to stay there, it's such a beautiful country, the food is incredible and the people are so nice. But what I miss most are definitely the scooter rides. In Thailand you don't need a license to drive a scooter, a helmet is recommended. During my last ride I tried to create a hyper lapse with my GoPro camera, I'm not really happy with the result, but it's all I've got:
