One month ago I started teaching a friend the basics of JavaScript with Meteor, Mantra and React.
Together we've built an app to create and share events with friends. It was an awesome experience. Yesterday we launched a private version on heroku. For us this was a great accomplishment. I learned a lot from this project and thought about sharing it with world.

Some technical features and challenges we solved:

* Access control for methods, publications and routing.
* Mobile first ui with material design.
* Fulltext search everywhere.
* File upload to Dropbox with Meteor-Files.
* Images with different thumbnails.
* Keyboard navigation in single views.
* Ready for deployment to heroku.

Thanks to the makers of Meteor, React, Mantra and Mantra-CLI.
