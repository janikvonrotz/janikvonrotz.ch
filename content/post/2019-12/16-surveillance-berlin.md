Last week I visited my favorite city Berlin once more. As the season changes so does Berlin. Clear and crisp air, dim lights and early sunsets brought the city into a different perspective. This time I wanted to know more about the GDR (German Democratic Republic) it's people and the surveillance machinery. For this I visited a Stasi prison and the HQ of the security bureau. It has been a tense and also fulfilling experience visiting this places. I don't want to talk about the GDR, but recommend everybody to read more about it. It is a remarkable historic event that has not been finished yet. Here are some pictures of the trip:

On the right is the planned economy of communism. Only a few people received this kind of motorcycle and only very few produced. On the left is the free market economy of capitalism. Cities have been overrun by these scooters. Regulations could not keep up to limit its usage and integrate them into the public service infrastructure.
