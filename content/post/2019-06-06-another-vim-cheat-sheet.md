Getting started with Vim is not easy. Fueled by an entirely different ecosystem of plugins, scripts and obscure workflows it is difficult to see the advantage of using Vim. But, to watch experienced people using Vim is always impressive and makes one eager to learn it.

This cheat sheet does not intend to provide you with a list of plugins and dotfiles, but aims at giving an overview of the most common commands. I assmelbed this document while learning to vim.

In order to unsertand these command I recommend to read about the following Vim topics first:

* leader key
* plugins with plug
* modes and buffers
