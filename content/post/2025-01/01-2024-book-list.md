*In* 2024 I read 4 books and 10 mangas. Even though I read more mangas than books, the list will still be called "book list". And there is another update. The rating is now on a scale of 5 point instead of 10.

My favorite book was **Landkkrank** by Nikolaj Schultz. And my favorite manga was **Ion Mud** by Amaury Bündgen.

And here is the full 2024 book list:
