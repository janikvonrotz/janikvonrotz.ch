I just upgraded my operating system [Pop!\_OS](https://pop.system76.com/) to the latest version and once again I was surprised by how far Linux has come. 
<!--more-->

The upgrade process went flawless. No obstacles as opting out of some obscure analytic services, or connecting my local account with an online account. It just works.

Pop!\_OS is an operating system for people which rely on good computing performance. Before, I have developed software on Windows and Mac OS, but none of them felt as fast as Pop!\_OS. I can recommend it to everyone!

Of course it works even better with the dedicated hardware by its maintainer [system76](https://system76.com/). I am using the *Lemur Pro 14"* laptop. It powerful, weights nothing and its battery goes on for hours. My old MacBook Air is gathering dust.

Give Pop!\_OS a try and if available by your next computer from system76.
