My local sports club [STV Kerns](https://www.tvkerns.ch) organized and performed a cinema themed gymnastic show [Turnerabend](http://turnerabend.ch). Together with other sports clubs we've put together a program and presented during two evenings and one after noon. During the event I was in charge of technical aspects and making photos of the show. Here are some of my favorites.
