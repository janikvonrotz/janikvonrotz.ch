Since the dawn of the internet I've been waiting for this feature. After every other chat app competitior (see line or telegram) have launched their web app, WhatsApp finally is available for your browser. Simply go to [https://web.whatsapp.com/](https://web.whatsapp.com/), scan a QR-code and start chatting with your friends.
