During the extended easter weekend I did a short trip with friends to the Provence. Despite the place is quite close to Switzerland the landscape is fairly different and unfamiliar. We lent a VW camper, drove through national parks and enjoyed the local food. Althought we only went there for four days we got mesmerized by the artistic villages and excellent vine ðŸ˜‰.
