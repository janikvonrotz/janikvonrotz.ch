While crawling the soundcloud newcomers and indie artists I felt in love with Sir Sly.

They seem a little bit shy about publicising personal informations but that doesn't really matter.

Their music is simple and solid, nice to hear by day and night.

You can follow them on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/SirSly" target="_blank">youtube</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sirsly" target="_blank">twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sirslymusic" target="_blank">facebook</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/sirsly" target="_blank">instagram</a>.
