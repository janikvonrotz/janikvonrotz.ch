In my last post I explained [how to map a keyboard key in linux](/2025/02/24/map-keyboard-key/). In this post I want to give instructions on how to survive the *American techno-imperialism*.

<!--more-->

For reader who have not heard about *techno-imperialism* before, let me give you a simple definition:

> American techno-imperialism refers to the U.S. using its technological power to dominate global markets, influence politics, and shape cultures, often at the expense of other nations autonomy.

The antagonist to techno imperialism is _digital sovereignty_. 

Digital sovereignty emphasizes the control and autonomy of nations over their own digital infrastructure, data, and technology policies.

Resisting external influence especially for democracies has become a crucial element. 

Democratic processes requires objectivity and healthy media coverage of events.

The influence of big tech in the realm of social media and beyond puts democratic processes at risk.

### Make Europe first but not

Gaining autonomy comes at the cost of severing connections.

The US has become an unstable partner. Thus having a strong alliance with European nations is key.

The ideas of autonomy, independence, sovereignty are striving.

However, the idea of sovereignty goes hand in hand with nationalism. And we don't want to repeat that past.

We have to make a clear distinction between those sovereignty and nationalism.

Sovereignty is not about closing borders and improving at the cost of foreigners. It is about cooperation and participation.

### Don't fall for fear mongering

The idea that we hardly can influence anything and are at the hand of other powers is staggering.

It is neither true nor is there any rationality to it.

How many people do live in Europe and how many do live the United States?

Europe is the cradle of democracy and its values. Lets make sure that we are up to this responsibility.

The EU has merit.

### Self-host, federate and cooperate

The techo-imperliasm implies that data and computing is power.

We depend too much on the US cloud and software providers.

With every transaction that goes abroad we hurt our own software industry.

Many say ( especially lobbyists) that there are no good alternatives to the established products.

But this is simply not true: <https://european-alternatives.eu/>

There are plenty European alternatives.

If you expect them to deliver the same features and experience you are mistaken.

The big tech services don't deserve any alternatives. The very existence of their products is a problem.

### Call out the bullies

So who are the bad guys?

From an economic viewpoint it is simple. Monopolists lead to a welfare loss.

Microsoft (business software), Google (search, browser), Apple (app store), Facebook (social media), Amazon (e-commerce) and SpaceX (space flight) are monopolists.

Therefore they are not good for the economy.

Moreover, the success of these companies can be traced back to the externalizing of costs. 

I am not sure what else you need know. And yes it is that simple!
