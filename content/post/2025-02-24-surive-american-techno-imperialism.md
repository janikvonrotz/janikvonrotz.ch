In my last post I explained [how to map a keyboard key in linux](/2025/02/24/map-keyboard-key/). In this post I want to give instructions on how to survive the *American techno-imperialism*.

<!--more-->

For reader who have not heard about *techno-imperialism* before, let me give you a simple definition:

> American techno-imperialism refers to the U.S. using its technological power to dominate global markets, influence politics, and shape cultures, often at the expense of other nations' autonomy.

The antagonist to techno imperialism is _digital sovereignty_.

Digital sovereignty emphasizes the control and autonomy of nations over their own digital infrastructure, data, and technology policies.

Resisting external influence especially for democracies has become crucial.

### Make Europe first but not

The idea of sovereignty goes hand in hand with nationalism.

We have to make a clear distinction between those two.

Sovereignty is not about closing borders it is about building participation processes.

### Don't fall for fear mongering

How many people do live in Europe and how many do live the United States?

We are an economic power. Let me give an example: The Norwegian pension fund.

The EU has merit.

### Self-host, federate and cooperate

We depends to much on the US cloud and software providers.

This hurts our own software industry and economy.

Many say (lobbyists) that there are no good alternatives.

But this is simply not true: <https://european-alternatives.eu/>

Also for big tech there should not be any alternatives, because the very existence of big tech is a problem.

### Call out the bullies

From an economic viewpoint it is simple. Monopolies lead to a welfare loss.

Microsoft (business software), Google (search, browser), Apple (app store), Facebook (social media), Amazon (e-commerce) and SpaceX (space flight) are monopolists.

Therefore they are not good for the economy.

I am not sure what else you need know. And yes it is that simple!
