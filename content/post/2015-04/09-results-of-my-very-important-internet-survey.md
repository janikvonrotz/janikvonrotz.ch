First some backgroud informations about why I've published this kind of survey:

There are many pulbic survey tools, but none of them offers the as much features as [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org).
To run surveys on my own, I've [installed  the LimeSurvey application](https://janikvonrotz.ch/2015/04/08/install-limesurvey-webapp/) on this server.
For more insight of how the user interacts with the surveys I've added [Piwik tracking for my LimeSurvey](https://janikvonrotz.ch/2015/04/09/enable-piwik-for-limesurvey/) installation.
To test the setup I've added a simple survey and posted the [link to the SampleSize subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/comments/31uvqp/casual_1_second_very_important_internet_survey/).

What started as a simple system test enraged people all over the world. I didn't expect anybody to contribute to this survey, nethertheless I had great discussion about crocs and nickelback.

Some awesome quotes from the thread:

> One second to read, a lifetime to choose an answer.

> It was hard, but in the end, Crocs don't make me bleed from the ears.

by [brown3jh](http://www.reddit.com/user/brown3jh)

> CROCS. I WEAR THEM.

by [monsto](http://www.reddit.com/user/monsto)

> Nickleback, no contest. I'd rather be forced to wear crocs for the rest of my life then listen to Nickelbutt.

# Results

Now I would like to present the results of this so important survey.

Obviously most people didn't bother to finish the survey. I can understand that.

Finally we know that Crocs are worse than Nickelback.
