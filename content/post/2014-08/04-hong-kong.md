The last 4 days I've spent in the absolutely astonishing city Hong Kong. So far the most crowded place I've seen. Skyscrapers that look like toothpicks stand so close to each other that you sometimes can't remember being in a city, it rather feels like being in a canyon. However getting around is still pretty easy, the MTR is convenient and some buses are even free to use. Without public transport this city wouldn't work.
