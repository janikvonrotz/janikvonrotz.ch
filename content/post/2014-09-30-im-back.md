My site has been down for one week. So what happened? Well, I still don't know :)

This website is hosted by Amazon Web Services. One week ago I updated and rebooted my EC2 server. Then it simply didn't boot anymore. I was very furious, that's a typical worst case scenario. Luckily the volume wasn't affected at all, so I was able to get my backups and configuration files without effort.

While the next few days I've set up a new server, it was a good chance to test my VPC tutorials again.

I'm really happy that I could restore the hole site so easily.

Thanks Amazon for nothing ;)
