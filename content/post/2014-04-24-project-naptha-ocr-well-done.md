On the [Project Naptha homepage](http://projectnaptha.com/) you can download a Google chrome extension that extends your browsers text copy function.

With the said extension you can copy text within images. Naptha recognises text inside images in real-time.

This is truly amazing, isn't it? They went even further! You can erase text from images and translate text in images to different languages.
