In 2021 I read 20 books. Some of them were good and some bad. Out of these books only two stuck with me: **Ilium** by Dan Simmons and **Flowers for Algernon** by Daniel Keyes.

**Ilium** is a must read for every fantasy and/or science fiction fan. It does not attract by a catchy story or using smart concept. The sheer unlimited creativeness gets one hooked on the book. Currently I am finishing the second book and it has been on of the largest I read in a while.

**Flowers for Algernon** is my definition of literature. Daniel writes about intelligence in a way that makes it much more understanding and compelling.

And here is the full 2021 book list:
