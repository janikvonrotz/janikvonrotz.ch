I found the perfect tool to record desktop actions: [Screen-To-Gif recorder](https://screentogif.codeplex.com/).
I'm using ScreenToGif almost every day to create short and precise online documations for my customer wiki.

Here's a gif recorded with ScreenToGif how I'm using ScreenToGif to create a gif of my desktop actions.
