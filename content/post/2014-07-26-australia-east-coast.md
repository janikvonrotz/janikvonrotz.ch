Within 3 weeks I've travelled the Australia East Coast. I've started in freezing cold Sydney and took a flight to Brisbane. From Brisbane I've travelled with the Greyhound buses up to Cairns and had a stop in Rainbow Beach (Fraser Island) and my favourite place Airlie Beach (Withsundays).

My personal highlight of this trip was the diving in the Great Barrier Reef. With Prodive, the biggest diving company in Australia, I've spent 2 days in the training center and 3 days on their boat with other divers. I accomplished the courses for the Open Water certificate which allows my to dive down to 18 meters and I also received the Adventure Diver certificate which allows my to dive down to 30 meters. This experience wasn't cheap, but worth every penny.
The scenery was absolutely astonishing, the colourful corals let you feel like you ended up on a another planet. Thanks to the experienced instructors (most of them have done over 2000 dives) I was able to see some rare creatures like a Lionfish, Elizabeth's Chromodoris and a Manta Ray.
Definitely a memory I'll never forget.

This time I've added 2 more pictures to the usual 10, enjoy it:
