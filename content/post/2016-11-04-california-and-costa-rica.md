During the last seven weeks I've spent a lot of time in California. With my study class we worked on projects with local companies in the Silicon Valley. It was a great experience. For the weekends I had decided to visit Yosemite and the beautiful lake Tahoe again. Despite the Californian drought I had some good hikes there. Before leaving for home I took a flight to Costa Rica and spent a week there. Seeing the caribbean  coast not on a post card was a very nice thing. Now here are some pictures you might like:
