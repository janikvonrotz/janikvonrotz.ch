[State of JavaScript 2018](https://stateofjs.com/) has just been released. It is one of the biggest survey about JavaScript development. If you wanna know what is going on in the confusing world of JS, make sure to pay a visit. They did a great job at visualizing and showcasing the results.

Seeing [GraphQL and Apollo](https://2018.stateofjs.com/data-layer/overview/) on the rise makes me quite happy. I am watching the development of these technologies since the very beginning. Next I will try to present these results at my current company and introduce them to the fancy way of software development.
