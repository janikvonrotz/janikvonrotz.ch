Awesome lists are a great thing on GitHub. It's about collecting useful resources, packages and modules of a certain technology or subject. It's the best way of introduction if you have to learn about a new technology.
Here's a good example of a [awesome Node.js list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs) by [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus) aka the inventor of bower, grunt and many other web tech.

I thought it would be a good idea to do the same for PowerShell. Maybe you've got some inputs for me, simply post them in the comment section or make fork of the [Awesome PowerShell repository](https://github.com/janikvonrotz/awesome-powershell) and commit your inputs directly.

So here's what I've got so far:
