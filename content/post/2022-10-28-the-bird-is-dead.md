> The bird is dead and so is social media.

As of 27th of October 2022 Elon Musk owns Twitter. With the $44 billion acquisition Twitter went private. As I am not a big fan of Musk (he is a megalomaniac) I think the time has come to quit Twitter. For me quitting Twitter is one more step to quit social media entirely.

The idea of social media is to connect people and make bonding easier. However, since years every social media platform is criticized for failing to moderate its communities and respecting its users privacy. Social media therefore is a failed project.

I don't see the merit of social media anymore and so I believe that we have to bury the bird and move on to something better.
