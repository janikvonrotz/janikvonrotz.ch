This time I want to tell you about the [netwars project](http://www.netwars-project.com/). It's a fact based cross platform experience exploring the impending threat of cyber warfare.

There's a web series, tv production, digital graphic novel and soon an audio book will be released.

The main subject is about cyberwarfare, but it's also a good insight into the mechanism of IT security and hacking.

For people who don't get all the cyber and security stuff, this documentation sure will be a great experience.
