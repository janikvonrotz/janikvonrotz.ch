Apparently the developer of TrueCrypt threw in the towel this week.

The official site [http://truecrypt.org](http://truecrypt.org) redirects to [http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/) where you'll find instructions to migrate you TrueCrypt disk to Microsofts built-in solution Bitlocker.

The reason for all this is obvious, TrueCrypt can't compete against Microsofts Bitlocker as their software comes with every Windows 8 version (withWindows 7 you had to have an enterprise license in order to use Bitlocker).
