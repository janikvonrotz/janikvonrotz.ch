I experienced several events during the last week:

- [Dinacon](https://dinacon.ch/) 2024 - a yearly conference about digital sustainability
- Playing the game [Factorio Space Age](https://www.factorio.com/space-age/overview)
- Not having access to [Codeium](https://codeium.com/) and therefore writing code "offline"
- Not being able to buy an [H100 GPU](https://www.amazon.com/NVIDIA-Graphics-Memory-Learning-Compute/dp/B0CMJCD2HG)

And even though these events seem very different they have a lot in common. This is all about over consumption and resource availability. Let me elaborate ...

**Power for the hungry**

At Dynacon there was a lot of talk about how tech companies and the tech industry can use any amount of power to train their large language models (LLMs) without being accountable to the actual usage of them.

To train a model you need a lot of graphics processing units (GPU). That is why Nvidia is one of the most valued companies. However, at the time of writing it is not possible to buy the popular H100 GPU. Big tech money can have all the shiny gpus there are on the market.

Acquiring the tools to compute is limited, but once you have the means to compute there are no limit. This fact presents itself in stark contrast to the climate crisis. Over consumption of common resources is the main cause for the climate crisis.

**Put on shackles**

Why don't we apply the same limit to resources to the tech industry? We already do this for any other other industry (transport, automotive, electronics, ...). This sure is a difficult question. My current assumption is that we simply depend too much on the tech industry. They themselves claim that "they are too big to care".

**Internet lock-in**

When coding I am using an LLM as a Service. My code editor sends the code that I am typing to an API and returns a completed version of the code. This is a powerful way of coding. However, when I found myself coding without internet connection I instantly felt powerless. I relied on this service to complete my code. And this is now how I want to lead!

**Taking the lead**

Taking the leadership in this context is taking the full responsibility and accountability for the used services. To simply depend on a service and buy the responsibility for a monthly subscription is not the way to go. We have to take the lead when it comes to solving real world problems.

**The solution**

What I am trying to explain here can be simulated in games. In Factorio you build, automate and expand a factory that produces goods with growing complexity. The game constantly confronts you with resource limits and attacks on the factory. When producing too much pollution the inhabitants of the planet will try to destroy the factory. You can choose to produce sustainable energy (which is hardly enough to run the factory) or improve the defense capabilities.

So much about the game. But what it makes really interesting is the fact that you can play this with your "friends". You have to cooperate, negotiate and make difficult decisions. Not often you end up argue about a virtual blueprint of a non-existing part of the factory. This seems ridiculous at first glance, but the process of solving this problem within those game parameters can produce solutions for the real world.

**What this is all about**

We cannot prompt our way out of the climate crisis. We have to take responsibility for the tools that we are using and the impact they have on our ecosystem.
