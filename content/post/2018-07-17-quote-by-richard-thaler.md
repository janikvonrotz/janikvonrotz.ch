> *People Arenâ€™t Dumb. The World Is Hard.*  
> -- Richard Thaler

Richard Thaler won a nobel prize for showing that humans tend to make irrational decisions. He is the founder of behavioral economics and took an unlikely way to success.

In the [latest Freakonomics podcast](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/richard-thaler/) Steve Dubner interviews Richard Thaler, clears some misunderstandings and gives insight on how Thaler deals with lazyness and his efforts to fix the world.

I love this quote because it emphasizes my personal view point. As an individium we feel obligated to know everything and strive for perfection in every domain of live. In contrast the world has become more complex and only through collaboration people can achieve anything at all.
